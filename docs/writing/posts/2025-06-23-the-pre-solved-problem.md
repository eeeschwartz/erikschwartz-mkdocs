A client told me a story that perfectly captures why I do this work.

He needed a specialized legal document for a project close to his heart. Had never drafted one before.

Instead of immediately calling his lawyer, he spent some time with AI. Created detailed prompts. Worked through multiple iterations.

Generated a comprehensive document that covered all the key elements.

Then he sent it to his counsel for review.

They made minimal changes and sent him a four-figure bill.

"That changed how I think about every bottleneck in my business," he said.

→ It wasn't about replacing expertise.

→ It was about doing the heavy lifting first.

→ So expensive knowledge could focus on what really mattered.

→ It redefined how he approached bottlenecks.

Now he's asking: What other patterns in my business could work this way?

Sometimes the most expensive thing you can do is not think differently about how work gets done.

Curious what problems are you pre-solving in your business?
