Your team is waiting for you to make decisions.

While you're in back-to-back meetings.

You've become the thing that's slowing down your business.

Here's what I see with otherwise great businesses with millions in revenue:

→ Every critical decision flows through the founder
→ Team has capability but can't execute with founder's intent
→ Growth is capped at the limit of founder's personal capacity
→ Founder is trapped in operational weeds

Sound familiar?

This isn't a people problem. It's an architecture problem.

The solution isn't hiring more people.
It's building systems that scale your judgment.

What's the biggest decision bottleneck in your business right now?
