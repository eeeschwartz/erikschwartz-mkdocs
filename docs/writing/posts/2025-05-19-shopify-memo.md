Every company on earth is sending out its version of Shopify's "use AI like it's your job" memo right now. Yours may have already. 

It brings up all sorts of confusion about where to start. Dabble with ChatGPT or build a world-changing agent?

But there's actually one critical concept that makes adoption way more impactful right away: it's a multiplayer game, not a single-player one.

What does multi-player AI adoption mean?

Years ago, I led a project that seemed on track. We were close to deadline, features looked great... except one. The tech for that piece just wasn't there. 

I thought we were okay given the many positives, but the client? They saw it differently. That one problem feature threatened the entire project's value. A classic, costly miscommunication.

Hard won experience helps mitigate miscommunication: deliver value early and often, etc. 

But it's still a challenge and who doesn't want access to more clarity?

This is where multi-player AI is amazing. And here's how to make it work for you:
 
1. Define Your Core Company Context: This is crucial. Don't guess. Articulate your company's values/mission/purpose. Why do you exist? What are your strengths, weaknesses, and goals? 

This isn't just another document; it could be the most important writing you do. It's invaluable on its own, and essential because AI is totally generic until *you* tell it who you are and what you care about.

2. Build Your Team's "Clarity Partner": Create a *shared* NotebookLM project (or Claude, though many already have NotebookLM via Google Workspace; ChatGPT doesn't offer shared projects yet). Upload your core company context. 

3. Empower Your AI Clarity Partner: Treat this shared space as your most insightful advisor and strategic partner. Remember, it gains its power from the team context you provide, the deep thinking you've done to define your 
team.

4. Spot Misalignments Early: Feed it your strategic docs, project ideas, meeting notes. Ask your AI Clarity Partner to flag where conversations or decisions might be drifting from your stated values or project goals. 

Do this as a team! Within days you will have improved your most important capability: to make high quality decisions together.

I wish it was there to help me spot my team's misalignment so many years ago.

And if you're looking to take action on your company's "use AI!" memo, I'd be happy to talk. Alignment and clarity is great place to start. Feel free to reach out.
