Every business owner wants to work ON their business, not IN it.

But here's the problem: You can't scale yourself if you don't understand how your team thinks.

Right now, your people are using AI individually. Sales uses ChatGPT for proposals. HR uses AI for screening. Finance has their own tools.

You're hearing conclusions, but you can't see their reasoning process.

Deloitte found that 26% of workers are using AI without their manager even knowing. That's not just an adoption gap—it's a leadership blind spot.

Meanwhile, Harvard research shows teams using coordinated AI are 3x more likely to produce top-tier solutions. Not because the AI is better, but because the team thinks better together.

(And why this changes everything about scaling leadership)
