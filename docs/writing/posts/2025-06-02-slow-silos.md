"People are the hard part."

That's what a design leader told me the other day when we were discussing AI coordination challenges.

Here's what I see everywhere:
→ 75% of knowledge workers using AI (Microsoft data)
→ 60% of leaders have no coordination plan
→ Result: Teams that can't learn from each other's thinking

This design leader's team was using AI to generate feedback on product docs. Smart approach. But each designer was doing it individually, in isolation.

When product management issues came up in 1-on-1s (a "perennial topic"), everyone used AI to brainstorm solutions. But nobody could see HOW their teammates were thinking through the same problems.

No shared assumptions. No visible reasoning. No way to learn from each other's approach.

Ben Thompson from Stratechery just cracked this: When his assistant shared ChatGPT conversation links instead of just conclusions, Thompson could trace every assumption, see the complete thought process, and build on the work seamlessly.

His reaction: "I was absolutely blown away."

This is the breakthrough: Teams need to understand each other's thought processes, not just share AI outputs.

When teams can see HOW each other thinks with AI, they build shared trust and learn from each other exponentially faster.

Individual AI adoption has a ceiling. But coordinated thinking? That compounds.

Can your team see each other's AI reasoning process, or just the results?
